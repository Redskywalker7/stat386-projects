Let's go on a journey together - a journey to be a Pokemon Master. We may not know too much about these awesome creatures, but armed with the data that helped us recently build a Pokedex, we have just what we need to learn more about the kind of Pokemon that will help us claim that grand title. 

A basic thing to know about Pokemon is that they are usually of a certain type. These types range from water and fire, to dragon and fairy types. Each type has vulnerabilities, or 'weakness' to certain other types, and is inversely 'super affective' against a few other types.Let's start by exploring which Pokemon types  have more of a comparitive advantage over others by looking at the top types by mean attacking and defensive stats from our Pokemon data. This would best be displayed as a bar chart:

Interesting, we see Ground and Steel appearing in the top five for both stats. Before we just settle on be-lining for Ground and Steel Pokemon, let's remind ourselves that these bar charts represent the means for each respective stat, so we are taking a lot of Pokemon into consideration. There may be more of a mix of weak and powerful pokemon amongst other types. In fact, we haven't even explored how each type type is represented within the Pokemon population as a whole
