## An Epic Goal
A few years ago, I decided that the ultimate personal fitness achievement would be the completion of a full distance Ironman event. Upon catching the vision, my disposable income was directed at the ultimate fitness tracking tool - a Garmin watch. 3 years later, I have hundreds of activities tracked, but no Ironman medal yet. Recently I've decided it is high time I dig out and lay bare the data to tell the story of the last 3 years worth of training. 

After a startling amount of data cleaning involving including the conversion of multiple metrics systems within the same column, and various data type fixes, I produced a dual-axis scatter plot with an overlayed line chart tracking both the indivudal distance travelled in each of my training and race activities, as well as a running total of what now amounts to nearly 2000 miles covered. I then switched from Python and Plotly to Photoshop to overlay some life information, including school semester timeframes, as well as life events like illness, pregnancies and birth. What this produced was a plot with which I could clearly see effect personal events had on my training. I could safely conclude that university and fatherhood don't produce realistic opportunities for competitive pysical accomplishments. I hope my research helps inform your future pysical goals too.
