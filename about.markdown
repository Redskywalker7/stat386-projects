I am Luke McDowell. I am a South African from South Africa, living in Utah with my New Mexican Wife. I have a 15 month-old son and a new baby on the way. I am obsessive, sporty, goal-driven and hypocritical. I love Manchester United, Formula 1, Star Wars, LEGO, Trading Cards, Plastic Model Kits, Simulator Racing, and most of all the Lord. I served a mission in Manchester England. I was named after Luke Skywalker.
